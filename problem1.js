/*
Suppose, we have to create many data for all the students of class. If there is about 200 students, then we have to make 200 data for them, which may lead us to write wrong codes as well as duplicate codes. For example:
*/

const student1 = {
    name: "Nahidul Islam",
    dateOfBirth: "22 November 2012",
    roll: 1
}

const student2 = {
    name: "Karib Shahriar",
    dateOfBirth: "12 April 2012",
    roll: 2
}

const student3 = {
    name: "Fahim Islam",
    dateOfBirth: "22 November 2014",
    roll: 3
}

const student4 = {
    name: "S M Rasel",
    dateOfBirth: "30 January 2013",
    roll: 3
}


// This list goes on like that. There is a beautiful solution for that in firstOOP.js file
